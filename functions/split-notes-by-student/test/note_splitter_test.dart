Today’s class went well overall. Oliver was very engaged during the group discussion and asked thoughtful questions about the homework. However, he’s still struggling a bit with subject-verb agreement in his writing, so I’ll need to provide him with some extra practice on that. Emma continues to be a strong student; she completed all her tasks quickly and with accuracy. That said, she’s still hesitant to speak up in class, so I’ll need to find ways to build her confidence during discussions. Lucas showed great creativity during the free writing activity, though he veered off-topic and needed some redirection. His reading fluency is improving, but unfamiliar words still trip him up occasionally. He worked really well with Sophia during their partner activity. Speaking of Sophia, she was fantastic at giving feedback during peer reviews, but her writing could use more varied vocabulary since she tends to repeat the same descriptive words. Liam had a slow start today and was a little distracted early on, but he made some insightful contributions during the persuasive writing discussion. His handwriting needs improvement; it’s often difficult to read. Next class, I’ll focus on speaking exercises and vocabulary building to support their growth.
