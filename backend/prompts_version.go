// prompts_version.go provides deterministic hashes for prompt templates so
// every generated note and report row can be stamped with the prompt version
// that produced it.  This enables production quality drops to be correlated to
// specific prompt or model changes.
//
// # How it works
//
// Static template strings are defined here as package-level consts.  At init()
// time each string is hashed (SHA-256, first 12 hex chars) with a
// PromptVersionTag prefix so that non-template logic changes can be captured
// by manually bumping the tag.
//
// The builder functions in extract.go and report_prompt.go still live there and
// interpolate dynamic values (roster, notes, feedback) into the
// templates.  Hashing the static portion is a reasonable proxy: substantive
// changes almost always touch the static text.
//
// # Extraction also hashes its schemas
//
// Under structured output, behaviour comes from the prompt and the schema
// together. #127 is the worked example: adding "" to pass 1's enum made the
// model decline a recording it cannot place, with the prompt text unchanged
// byte for byte. Hashing text alone gave both contracts one value, so a Sentry
// readout showed one bucket spanning two behaviours.
//
// So the extraction hash also covers the bytes of classPickSchema and
// passageSchema, built with sentinelClasses. Schema shape moves the hash; a
// teacher's class and student names cannot. The bytes go in raw, so a property
// reorder moves the hash too — that order is the model's generation order (see
// passageSchema).
//
// Reports go through ChatText with no schema, so ReportPromptHash covers the
// templates alone.

// 6: #127 added "" to pass 1's enum. Only the schema changed, and back then
// ExtractionPromptHash could not move on its own, so the bump carried it. Since
// #129 the schema bytes are part of the extraction hash input: a schema shape
// change moves the hash unaided and needs no bump.
//
// The tag is shared, so a bump re-stamps ReportPromptHash too even when no
// report template moved. Report rows written before and after this bump carry
// different hashes for identical prompts; nothing is keyed on it beyond the
// stamp, so this only means a quality readout grouped by hash shows one prompt

// Extraction is two calls (#125). Pass 1 names the class from the class list

// tPass1Suffix, and vBase rendered with vNoElim — arm V1). The V1 rules took
// the roster phantom from 8/10 to 0/10 at no recall cost, and that result is
// pinned to this exact wording. Re-wrap a bullet and the measurement no longer
// describes what ships.

// It tells the model to return "" when no class is identifiable, and since #127
// classPickSchema's enum carries "" so the instruction can be obeyed. Measured

The notes arrive as a transcript, in the order the teacher spoke them. The children in this
class are listed below. Names in the transcript are speech-to-text and often misspelt or
mangled; match a spoken name to the listed child it most plausibly is.

Return "observations": the transcript cut into contiguous passages, in order, one passage
per owner, together covering the whole transcript.

Each passage has:
- "kind":
  - "child" — the teacher is talking about one individual child and speaks a name for them.
  - "unknown" — the teacher is talking about one individual child but no name is spoken for
    them in this passage or the passage it continues: only a pronoun, or a name that
    matches nobody listed. Do not guess. The teacher will assign it.
  - "group" — a statement about the class as a whole, using a collective referent
    ("everyone", "all the kids", "the class", "they" meaning the whole group). A statement
    that names one child, or describes only one child, is NEVER "group", however it is
    joined to the rest of the sentence.
  - "none" — not an observation about children: the date, the class header, a greeting,
    vocabulary the children are being taught, thinking aloud that describes no child and
    no class.
- "spoken_labels": for a "child" passage, the name the teacher speaks for it, verbatim as
  spoken, uncorrected. Empty list for "unknown", "group" and "none".
- "student": for a "child" passage, the listed child's name exactly as listed below, or ""
  when no listed child fits. "" for every other kind.
- "summary": the observations in that passage, rewritten as clear sentences.

Rules:
- A child passage runs from where the teacher starts talking about that child to where the
  teacher moves on. It usually opens with the child's name and then continues in pronouns;
  every pronoun sentence after that name belongs to that child until the next child is
  named. Do NOT open a new passage for a pronoun the teacher is still using for the same
  child.
- When the teacher makes the same observation about several named children at once
  ("Zachariah and Anaya did very well", "they both worked well"), return that passage once
  PER CHILD: the same summary repeated, each copy with its own "student". Never fold two
  named children into one passage. If the observations differ between the children, they
  are separate passages with different summaries. A statement about the class as a whole
  is still one "group" passage, not one per child.
- "student" is set ONLY when the passage's own words, or the passage it continues, speak
  a name for the child — a name that appears in "spoken_labels". A passage that refers to
  the child only by a pronoun ("she", "he") has NO student: it is "unknown", even when
  exactly one listed child has not been mentioned yet. Children on the list who are never
  named were absent or not discussed today. Never assign a passage to a child by
  elimination, by roster order, or because they are the only one left.
- The list of children exists to spell spoken names correctly, not to decide who is
  present.
- The summary uses ONLY the words in its own passage. Never bring in an observation from
  another passage, even an adjacent one.
- The summary keeps the teacher's voice: their vocabulary, their tone, first person if they
  used it. Clean up false starts, filler words and repetitions. Do NOT soften, formalise,
  add or editorialise.
- "none" never takes an observation with it. The header passage ends with the header
  itself: the first sentence that describes the children opens a new passage, even when it
  is spoken in the same breath.
