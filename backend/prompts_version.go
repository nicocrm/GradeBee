// prompts_version.go provides deterministic hashes for prompt templates so
// every generated note and report row can be stamped with the prompt version
// that produced it.  This enables production quality drops to be correlated to
// specific prompt or model changes.
//
// # How it works
//
// Static template strings are defined here as package-level consts.  At init()
// time each string is hashed (SHA-256, first 12 hex chars) with a
// PromptVersionTag prefix so that non-template logic changes can be captured
// by manually bumping the tag.
//
// The builder functions in extract.go and report_prompt.go still live there and
// interpolate dynamic values (roster, notes, feedback) into the
// templates.  Hashing the static portion is a reasonable proxy: substantive
// changes almost always touch the static text.

import (
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/hex"

// PromptVersionTag is bumped manually when non-template logic changes (e.g.
// branching behaviour inside builder functions that hashing the template alone
// would not catch).  Format: monotonic integer as string.

const extractionPromptPrefix = `You are a teaching assistant analyzing a teacher's audio
transcript about student observations.

Your task:
1. Identify which students are mentioned in the transcript
2. Match each mentioned name to the student roster below (handle phonetic/partial matches)
3. Extract the date if mentioned (format YYYY-MM-DD), otherwise leave empty
4. Split the transcript into individual observations and attribute each one to a single
   owner: one named student, or the class as a whole. A single sentence often carries
   several observations about different students ("Luis struggled, whereas Rayan was on
   fire and Gatien kept interrupting" is three separate observations) — split it at the
   clause level rather than treating the sentence as one unit.
5. Write a summary per student from the observations owned by that student, plus the
   observations owned by their class
   - Clean up speech artifacts (false starts, filler words, repetitions) into clear
     sentences
   - Preserve the teacher's voice, tone, and specific observations — do NOT add details
     or opinions not present in the transcript
   - Keep the teacher's vocabulary and perspective (first person if they used it)
   - Combine multiple mentions of the same student into a cohesive note
   - Never put an observation owned by one student into another student's summary

Student Roster:
`

// extractionPromptSuffix is the static rules block that closes every extraction
// prompt (after the per-class roster).
//
// Bullets wrap at roughly 90 columns with a two-space continuation indent, so
// each "- " marks a new rule and everything indented under it belongs to the
// rule above.
const extractionPromptSuffix = `
Rules:
- Match mentioned names against the roster even if pronunciation differs slightly
- Some roster entries include "(aka ...)" aliases — if a teacher uses an alias, match it
  to the canonical name and return the canonical name in the "name" field
- Set confidence 0.0-1.0 for each match. Use >= 0.7 for confident matches.
- If confidence < 0.7, include up to 3 closest roster matches in "candidates"
- "class_name" is REQUIRED to be one of the roster's real class names — you cannot leave
  it blank or invent one.
- Before setting confidence, check the roster for the mentioned name: if it appears under
  more than one class and the transcript gives no clue which class is meant, the class is
  a guess. Still pick one class_name, but set that entry's confidence to 0.3 so it is not
  auto-created against the guess, and list the other plausible (name, class_name) pairs in
  "candidates". Reserve a confidence above 0.5 for a class_name you are actually sure of.
- A student is "individually mentioned" ONLY if the teacher uses their name (or a
  recognizable nickname/variant of their name). Generic group references like "everyone",
  "all students", "the class" do NOT count as individual mentions.
- Do NOT create entries for students who are never individually mentioned by name. If a
  student is only covered by group-level observations (e.g. "the class was loud") but
  never called out by name, they must NOT appear in the output.
- Each student's quoted_text must contain ONLY (a) the observations the teacher made about
  that student and (b) group-level observations about that student's class. It MUST NOT
  contain an observation about any other named student, even one made in the same
  sentence. Never copy the whole transcript into every entry.
- A "group-level observation" is a statement about the class as a whole — it uses a
  collective referent such as "everyone", "all the kids", "the class", "they" (meaning the
  whole group). A statement that names a student, or describes only one student, is NEVER
  a group-level observation, no matter how it is joined to the rest of the sentence.
  Conjunctions and contrasts ("but", "and", "whereas", "while", "although", a comma) join
  separate individual observations; they do not merge them into one shared observation.
- Only group-level observations are shared between students. Append each one to the
  quoted_text of every individually-mentioned student in that class, wherever it fell in
  the transcript (beginning, middle, or end) and whoever was named next to it. Individual
  observations are never shared: they appear in exactly one entry, their own student's.
  Example A (a group observation is shared): Transcript says "Alice did great. Bob was
    quiet. The whole class struggled with fractions." → Alice's quoted_text is "Alice did
    great. The whole class struggled with fractions." and Bob's is "Bob was quiet. The
    whole class struggled with fractions." BOTH carry the fractions observation; NEITHER
    carries the other student's individual observation.
  Example B (one sentence, several students, nothing shared): Transcript says "Priya was
    on fire the whole hour, whereas Sam kept interrupting and Dan never opened his book."
    → Priya's quoted_text is "Priya was on fire the whole hour.", Sam's is "Sam kept
    interrupting.", Dan's is "Dan never opened his book." No collective referent appears,
    so nothing is shared and each entry names only its own student.
- If the transcript contains group references like "everyone", "all students", or "the
  class", apply those observations only to students in the class being discussed, not to
  ALL classes. Use context clues (class name mentions, prior student mentions) to
  determine which class is meant.
- Produce exactly one entry for every individually-mentioned student, in every class the
  transcript covers. A transcript that moves from one class to the next still owes an
  entry for each student named in each of them — do not stop after the first class.
- If a mentioned student cannot be matched to any roster entry, do not include them in the
  output
- If no students are clearly mentioned, return an empty students array
- The "class_name" field for each student MUST exactly match one of the class names from
  the roster above. Do not invent or abbreviate class names — if you are unsure which
  class a student belongs to, see the confidence/candidates rule above.
- IMPORTANT: Clean up speech into readable sentences, but do NOT invent observations or
  editorialize. Stay faithful to what the teacher actually said.
