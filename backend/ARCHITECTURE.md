# Backend Architecture

## Overview

Go HTTP backend for GradeBee, a teacher tool for managing student rosters, processing audio recordings (upload → transcribe), and generating report cards. Runs as a standalone HTTP server.

**Deployment topology:** The Go binary embeds the React frontend via `embed.FS` and serves it directly. Dokku's nginx proxy handles TLS termination and gzip compression. No Caddy sidecar. See `Dockerfile` for the multi-stage build that copies the frontend `dist/` into `backend/static/` before the Go compile step.

**Package:** `handler` (all source files in `backend/` share this package).

**Storage:** SQLite database (`modernc.org/sqlite`) with WAL mode. Audio files stored on local disk. No Google Sheets/Docs — all data in SQLite.

## Domain Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Level** | A Group-owned curriculum tier (e.g. "Grade 3", "Intermediate"), curated by the Admin via the Levels screen. Carries shared Report Instructions that will guide report generation. Referenced by Classes via `classes.level_id` (`NOT NULL`, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`). |
| **Schedule** | An optional time-slot or period label (e.g. "Period 1", "Morning"). Distinguishes multiple sections taught at the same level. |
| **Class** | A concrete teaching group — a **Level instance**. References a required Level (`level_id`) plus an optional `schedule_name`. A teacher may have multiple classes at the same level (different schedules). The display name (`Class.Name`) is derived in SQL from the Level's name plus `schedule_name`, never stored — renaming a Level immediately renames every Class using it. |
| **Student** | A learner belonging to exactly one class. |
| **Note** | A per-student observation extracted from a voice or text upload. |
| **Report** | An LLM-generated report card for one student, drawing on their notes and matching examples. |

## Entrypoint & Routing

**`handler.go`** — exports `Handle(w, r)`, the single HTTP handler. Routes use `strings.HasPrefix` + `pathParam()` for parameterized paths.

All API routes live under `/api/*`. The `Handle` function strips the `/api/` prefix, sets JSON `Content-Type` and CORS headers, then dispatches to handlers via a `switch` on the rewritten path. `/health` is exposed at the root (outside `/api/`) for uptime probes.

Anything else falls through to the embedded SPA handler (`spaHandler()` in `static.go`), which serves files from the embedded `static/` directory with `try_files`-style fallback to `index.html` for SPA client-side routing.

Cache headers:
- `/assets/*` (hashed filenames) → `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- SPA fallback (`index.html`) → `Cache-Control: no-cache`

Auth is Clerk JWT via `clerkhttp.RequireHeaderAuthorization()` middleware. CORS handled inline (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS).

## Async Upload Processing Pipeline

Audio uploads are processed asynchronously via a generic in-memory queue (`MemQueue[VoiceNoteJob]`) with a background worker pool. Jobs are dispatched from `POST /api/voice-notes/upload` and `POST /api/voice-notes/drive-import` after the file is saved to disk.

### Flow

```
User uploads audio
        │
        ▼
  POST /voice-notes/upload (or /voice-notes/drive-import)
        │  Saves file to disk, creates voice_notes row,
        │  publishes VoiceNoteJob to MemQueue
        │
        ▼
  MemQueue worker goroutine
        │  Picks job key from buffered channel
        │
        ▼
  processVoiceNote(ctx, deps, queue, key)
        │
        ├─ Idempotency check: skip if job status ≠ "queued"
        │
        ├─ Step 1: Transcribe (status → "transcribing")
        │    Read audio from local disk → LLM provider (Voxtral or Whisper)
        │    Context bias seeded with class names from DB roster
        │
        ├─ Step 2: Extract (status → "extracting")
        │    Send transcript + student roster to LLM provider
        │    → per-student observations (name, class, quoted_text, confidence)
        │    Note: quoted_text contains verbatim passages from the transcript.
        │    Stored in the notes table `summary` column (legacy name, no migration needed).
        │
        ├─ Step 3: Create Notes (status → "creating_notes")
        │    For each student with confidence ≥ 0.5:
        │      Resolve name → student ID via FindByNameAndClass
        │      Create note in SQLite via dbNoteCreator
        │
        └─ Done (status → "done", mark voice note processed)
```

On failure at any step, the job status is set to `"failed"` with the error message. Users can retry failed jobs via `POST /voice-notes/jobs/retry`.

Job status is tracked in-memory (map keyed by `userId/<uploadId>`). The frontend polls `GET /voice-notes/jobs` to show progress.

### Startup

`cmd/server/main.go` calls `InitVoiceNoteQueue(d, 4)` at startup to create the queue with 4 worker goroutines. The queue is shut down gracefully on SIGINT/SIGTERM.

### Voice Note Cleanup

Audio files are deleted from disk **immediately after successful transcription** in `voice_note_process.go`. The `purged_at` column on `voice_notes` records when this happened. The background cleanup goroutine (`voice_note_cleanup.go`) then removes the DB row after the retention period (default 7 days, configurable via `UPLOAD_RETENTION_HOURS`), skipping file deletion for rows already purged.

### Generic Queue Infrastructure

The queue system uses Go generics for type safety:

- **`Keyed`** — constraint interface requiring `JobKey() string` and `OwnerID() string`
- **`JobQueue[T Keyed]`** — generic interface for async job operations (Publish, GetJob, UpdateJob, ListJobs, DeleteJob, Close)
- **`MemQueue[T Keyed]`** — in-memory implementation with buffered channel + worker pool
- **`ProcessFunc[T Keyed]`** — function type called by workers: `func(ctx, queue, key) error`

Each job type gets its own queue instance. The processor function is injected at construction via closure, keeping the generic queue status-agnostic.

### Report Example Extraction Pipeline

PDF and image report card uploads are processed asynchronously:

```
User uploads PDF/image
        │
        ▼
  POST /report-examples (or /drive-import-example)
        │  Saves file to disk, creates report_examples row
        │  with status='processing', publishes ExtractionJob
        │
        ▼
  MemQueue[ExtractionJob] worker goroutine
        │
        ├─ Read file from disk
        ├─ For PDFs: convert to JPEG images via pdftoppm (150 DPI)
        ├─ Send each page to GPT Vision (parallel, structured JSON output)
        ├─ Update report_examples row: status='ready', content=extracted text
        └─ Clean up temp file from disk
```

Text file uploads (plain text, JSON body) are stored synchronously with `status='ready'`.

The frontend polls `GET /report-examples` every 3s while any example has `status='processing'`.

## Dependency Injection

**`deps.go`** — defines `deps` interface + `prodDeps` implementation + package-level `serviceDeps` variable.

```
deps interface {
    GetTranscriber()      → Transcriber
    GetRoster(ctx, userID) → Roster
    GetExtractor()        → Extractor
    GetNoteCreator()      → NoteCreator
    GetExampleStore()     → ExampleStore
    GetExampleExtractor() → ExampleExtractor
    GetReportGenerator()  → ReportGenerator
    GetVoiceNoteQueue()   → JobQueue[VoiceNoteJob]
    GetDriveClient(ctx, userID) → DriveClient
    GetDB()               → *sql.DB
    GetClassRepo()        → *ClassRepo
    GetStudentRepo()      → *StudentRepo
    GetNoteRepo()         → *NoteRepo
    GetReportRepo()       → *ReportRepo
    GetExampleRepo()      → *ReportExampleRepo
    GetVoiceNoteRepo()    → *VoiceNoteRepo
    GetLevelRepo()        → *LevelRepo
    GetUploadsDir()       → string
}
```

Tests override `serviceDeps` with stubs. All handler functions call through this interface, never instantiate services directly.

### Key Interfaces

| Interface | File | Prod Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------------------|---------|
| `deps` | `deps.go` | `prodDeps` | Top-level DI container |
| `Roster` | `roster.go` | `dbRoster` | Read student data from DB |
| `Transcriber` | `transcriber.go` | `providerTranscriber` | Audio→text via LLMProvider (Voxtral or Whisper) |
| `Extractor` | `extract.go` | `llmExtractor` | Transcript→student extraction via LLMProvider |
| `NoteCreator` | `notes.go` | `dbNoteCreator` | Create notes in SQLite |
| `ExampleStore` | `report_examples.go` | `dbExampleStore` | CRUD for example report cards |
| `ExampleExtractor` | `report_example_extractor.go` | `llmExampleExtractor` | Vision text extraction from images; PDF→image via pdftoppm |
| `ReportGenerator` | `report_generator.go` | `llmReportGenerator` | LLM-based report card generation (HTML output) |
| `JobQueue[VoiceNoteJob]` | `job_queue.go` | `MemQueue[VoiceNoteJob]` | Generic in-memory async job queue with worker pool |
| `JobQueue[ExtractionJob]` | `job_queue.go` | `MemQueue[ExtractionJob]` | Async report example extraction queue |

## External Services

### Google OAuth (`google.go`)
- Auth: Clerk JWT → extract user ID → Google OAuth token (used for Drive Picker import).
- **Note:** Google Drive was replaced by SQLite as the primary data store. Drive Picker import remains active for importing audio files and report examples from a user's own Drive.

### Clerk (`auth.go`)
- JWT verification via middleware.
- OAuth token retrieval: `user.ListOAuthAccessTokens` for `oauth_google`.
- `userIDFromRequest(r)` extracts user ID from Clerk session claims (in `handler.go`).
- `groupIDFromRequest(r)` — extracts the active Clerk Organization ID (`ActiveOrganizationID`) from verified session claims. Returns `403 unauthorized` if claims are absent, `403 no_active_org` if no org is active (user not yet in a Group).
- `isAdmin(r)` — returns `true` if the session role is `"org:admin"` (uses `SessionClaims.HasRole`).
- `debugAuthMiddleware` enforces the active-org gate after Clerk JWT verification: any verified request with an empty `ActiveOrganizationID` is rejected with `403 no_active_org` before reaching the handler. `/health` and static routes are outside this middleware.
- **Phase 2:** `levels` table added (`sql/010_levels.sql`), Group-owned and scoped by `group_id` (the active Clerk Organization ID). `LevelRepo` (`repo_level.go`) enforces the Group boundary on every method; `/api/levels` reads are open to any Group member, writes (`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`) require `isAdmin(r)`. `classes.level_id` (`sql/011_class_level_id.sql`) wires Classes to Levels; `ClassRepo.Create`/`Update` validate `level_id` belongs to the caller's Group, rejecting a forged cross-Group reference.

### LLM Provider (`llm_provider*.go`)

A `LLMProvider` interface abstracts all LLM call sites. Two production implementations exist:
- `openaiProvider` — wraps `go-openai` client against `https://api.openai.com/v1` (chat/vision) and OpenAI Whisper (transcription).
- `mistralProvider` — wraps `go-openai` client against `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` (chat/vision via OpenAI-compat endpoint) and ZaguanLabs `mistral-go/v2/sdk` for Voxtral transcription.

`LoadProvider()` reads `LLM_PROVIDER` (default `"mistral"`), validates the active provider's API key, logs the selected models, and returns the provider. Called from `NewProdDeps` so the binary fails fast on misconfiguration.

Per-task model IDs are configured via `LLM_MODEL_EXTRACTION`, `LLM_MODEL_REPORT`, `LLM_MODEL_VISION`, `LLM_MODEL_TRANSCRIPTION` env vars (provider-specific defaults apply if unset).


Context bias: `providerTranscriber` passes class names from the DB roster to `provider.Transcribe(...)`. `openaiProvider` joins them as a Whisper prompt; `mistralProvider` sanitises them (space→`_`, drop commas, dedup, cap 100) and passes via Voxtral's `context_bias` field.

### Audio format handling (`transcriber.go`, `audio_format.go`)
- Handles audio format detection and 3GP→MP4 patching (`audio_format.go`).

## Database

SQLite with WAL mode (`db.go`). Migrations embedded via `embed.FS` (`migrate.go`, `sql/001_init.sql`).

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `classes` | A **class** is a Level instance: a required `level_id` FK (`NOT NULL`, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`) plus an optional `schedule_name`. `Class.Name` and `Class.LevelName` are not stored — both are derived in SQL by joining `levels` (`levels.name` alone, or `levels.name–schedule_name` when a schedule is set), so renaming a Level immediately renames every Class using it. `Class.LevelName` is used to match report-card examples for style (see `report_example_classes`, still keyed by the bare Level name). |
| `report_example_classes` | M-M link: report examples ↔ Level names (drives example selection for style matching at report generation; still free text — untouched by #57, see ADR-0002 and the Phase 2 plan for the accepted "9 classes load no examples" consequence). |
| `students` | Students belonging to classes |
| `student_aliases` | Nickname/variant aliases per student (per-class uniqueness, case-insensitive) |
| `notes` | Observation notes per student |
| `reports` | Generated HTML report cards |
| `report_examples` | Example report cards for style matching |
| `voice_notes` | Audio file tracking (file path, processed_at, purged_at) |
| `levels` | Group-owned curriculum tiers. `name` unique within `group_id`; `report_instructions` defaults to `''`; empty/whitespace-only blocks report generation for that Level (`400`, see `reports_handler.go`). Seeded with 8 hand-authored Levels against the production Clerk org ID (one-shot data migration, `sql/010_levels.sql`). |

### Repository Layer

Each table has a `Repo*` type in `repo_*.go` files providing type-safe CRUD.

## Authorization Pattern

All CRUD endpoints verify resource ownership:
1. Extract `userID` from Clerk JWT claims via `userIDFromRequest(r)`
2. Extract `groupID` from the active Clerk Organisation via `groupIDFromRequest(r)` (available from Phase 1; used for scoped queries from Phase 2 onward)
3. For class operations: query class, check `class.UserID == userID`
4. For student operations: `studentRepo.BelongsToUser(studentID, userID)`
5. For note/report operations: join through student → class to verify ownership

The `debugAuthMiddleware` enforces that every `/api/` request carries an active Clerk Organization (`ActiveOrganizationID != ""`). Requests without an active org receive `403 no_active_org` before reaching any handler.

## Type Generation (Go → TypeScript)

[tygo](https://github.com/gzuidhof/tygo) generates `frontend/src/api-types.gen.ts` from Go structs with `json` tags. The frontend imports generated types instead of maintaining hand-written interfaces.

- Config: `backend/tygo.yaml`
- Generate: `cd backend && make generate`
- Check up-to-date: `cd backend && make check-types` (runs in root `make test`)
- Embedded struct flattening uses `tstype:",extends"` tags (see `ClassWithCount`, `ReportDetail`)
- `time.Time` maps to `string` via `type_mappings`

When changing Go structs with `json` tags, regenerate types and commit the updated `.gen.ts` file.

## Error Handling

`apiError` struct (`google.go`) carries HTTP status, machine-readable code, human message, and an optional `Details map[string]string` field for structured context (e.g. `conflictStudentName` on alias collision). Handlers check `errors.As(err, &apiError)` and call `writeAPIError`. All responses are JSON.

Repo-level errors:
- `ErrNotFound` — entity not found
- `ErrDuplicate` — generic unique constraint violation (used by class/student/note repos)
- `*ErrDuplicateAlias` — alias-specific conflict that carries the canonical name of the student who owns the conflicting alias, so the handler can include it in the 409 `details` field
- `*ErrLevelInUse` — carries the count of Classes still referencing a Level being deleted, so `handleDeleteLevel` can return a 409 stating how many Classes must move first; the DB's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on `classes.level_id` backs this up but can't name the count itself

## Observability / Sentry

`github.com/getsentry/sentry-go` v0.46.2. `InitSentry()` (`sentry.go`) reads `SENTRY_DSN` / `SENTRY_RELEASE` / `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` at startup — no-op if DSN is empty. `sentryhttp` middleware wraps the top-level handler in `main.go` (auto-captures panics; `Repanic: true`). Authenticated requests are tagged with the Clerk user ID. `BeforeSend` scrubs request bodies, query strings, cookies, auth headers, and name-shaped strings from exception values. `captureFeedback()` is available for non-error feedback events (task #19). DSN and release are baked into the Docker image via `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_APP_VERSION` build-args → `ENV SENTRY_DSN` / `ENV SENTRY_RELEASE` in Stage 3.

### Structured Logs

`InitLogger()` (`logger.go`) must be called after `InitSentry()`. When `SENTRY_DSN` is set it builds a `slog.NewMultiHandler` combining the stdout handler with a `sentryslog` handler (`github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/slog`). All `log.Info/Warn/Error` call sites are unchanged. Default `sentryslog` behaviour: `Debug`/`Info`/`Warn` → Sentry structured log entry only; `Error`/`Fatal` → structured log entry **and** a Sentry event (Issue).

## Testing

- Tests in `*_test.go` files override `serviceDeps` with stubs.
- `testutil_test.go` has shared test helpers (`stubVoiceNoteQueue`, `mockDepsAll`, etc.).
- `setupTestDB(t)` creates an in-memory SQLite DB with migrations for handler tests.
- Run: `make test` / `make lint`

## LLM Evaluation Harness

Regression testing for extraction and report-generation quality. On-demand only (`make eval`) — not CI-gated.

### Directory layout

```
backend/evals/
  promptfooconfig.yaml          promptfoo test suite
  baseline.json                 pinned baseline scores (committed to repo)
  scoring/extraction.js         custom JS precision/recall + voice-preservation scorer
  scripts/diff-baseline.js      baseline diff reporter (Node, always exits 0)
  results/                      per-run result JSONs (git-ignored)
  fixtures/
    extraction/<case>/
      transcript.txt            teacher audio transcript (synthetic)
      classes.json              class roster
      expected.json             expected students + must_quote_substrings
    reports/<case>/
      notes.json                student notes
      examples.json             example report cards (optional)
      instructions.txt          additional prompt instructions (optional)
```

### Running evals

```bash
# One-time eval — prints diff vs baseline
cd backend && make eval

# Update baseline after deliberate prompt/model change
cd backend && make eval-baseline   # runs eval then copies latest result to baseline.json
# Commit evals/baseline.json alongside the prompt change
```

### How to add a fixture

1. Create `backend/evals/fixtures/{extraction,reports}/<descriptive-name>/` with the required files (see layout above).
2. Add a test entry in `promptfooconfig.yaml` pointing at the new fixture.
3. Run `make eval` to see the score; if it looks right, run `make eval-baseline`.

### Baseline lifecycle

`backend/evals/baseline.json` is a single committed file overwritten by `make eval-baseline`. The PR diff is the audit trail — deliberately accepting new scores.

### How it works

`make eval` builds `bin/eval-cli` (from `cmd/eval-cli/`), then invokes promptfoo. For each test case, promptfoo calls eval-cli as an **exec-prompt function** (passing a single JSON arg), and eval-cli returns a messages array — no LLM call. Promptfoo sends the messages to its native OpenAI provider (with structured output schema for extraction), scores the response, and writes results. Model selection lives entirely in `promptfooconfig.yaml`; `EVAL_MODEL` is no longer read.

Debug a single case:
```bash
cd backend
make bin/eval-cli
./bin/eval-cli '{"vars":{"transcript":"Alice","classes":[]},"config":{"task":"build-extract-prompt"}}'
```

### Eval CLI (`cmd/eval-cli`)

| Config task | Reads from `vars` | Builds |
|---|---|---|
| `build-extract-prompt` | `transcript`, `classes` | `BuildExtractionPrompt` → messages array (system + user) |
| `build-report-prompt` | `student_name`, `class`, `notes`, `examples`, `report_instructions`, `instructions` | `BuildReportPrompt` → messages array (user only) |

Model selection and the actual LLM call belong to promptfoo, not eval-cli.

## User Feedback (artifact_feedback table)

Captures explicit thumbs ratings (👍/👎) and implicit signals (regenerate / edit / delete on auto notes) to feed a fixture-mining flywheel.

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE artifact_feedback (
  id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  artifact_type  TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (artifact_type IN ('report', 'note')),
  artifact_id    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  rating         TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (rating IN ('up', 'down')),
  signal         TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'explicit'
                 CHECK (signal IN ('explicit', 'regenerated', 'edited', 'deleted')),
  comment        TEXT,          -- explicit/regenerated signals
  previous_value TEXT,          -- edited/deleted signals (original content)
  user_id        TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

**Append-only** — code never UPDATEs rows, only INSERTs. Multiple edits → multiple rows.

### Signal taxonomy

| signal | rating | When inserted |
|---|---|---|
| `explicit` | `up`/`down` | User clicks 👍/👎 in `ReportViewer` or `NotesList` |
| `regenerated` | `down` | User clicks Regenerate on a report |
| `edited` | `down` | User edits an auto-extracted note |
| `deleted` | `down` | User deletes an auto-extracted note |

Only **explicit thumbs-down** events fire a Sentry dual-write (via `captureFeedback`).

### Prompt + model versioning

Every generated `report` row and auto-extracted `note` row is stamped with:
- `model_version` — the LLM model ID that produced the note (e.g. `"mistral-medium-2508"`); raw model ID, no provider prefix; `NULL` for manually-created notes
- `prompt_hash` — first 12 hex chars of SHA-256(`PromptVersionTag + ":" + template`) from `prompts_version.go`

`NULL` on pre-instrumentation rows. Filter `WHERE prompt_hash IS NOT NULL` when correlating quality.

`PromptVersionTag` is a manually-bumped monotonic integer for non-template logic changes.
