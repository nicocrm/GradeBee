# Agent Instructions

## Where to Find Information

Before starting work, consult the relevant doc:

| Topic | Source of Truth |
| --- | --- |
| Project overview, setup, tech stack | `README.md` |
| Backend architecture, patterns, conventions | `backend/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Frontend design system (colors, typography, components) | `frontend/DESIGN.md` |
| Implementation plans, RFCs, design docs | `docs/` |
| Deep codebase analysis, quick references, diagrams | `docs/analysis/` |
| End-to-end test examples | `e2e/` |
| Environment variables | `.env.example` |

When an authoritative doc exists for a topic, **read it first** rather than re-deriving knowledge from the code.

## Go Backend

Refer to `backend/ARCHITECTURE.md` for backend architecture, patterns, and implementation guidelines.
Update this document when the backend is updated.

## Frontend Design

Follow the design system documented in `frontend/DESIGN.md` for all UI work. Use the established color tokens, typography, and component patterns.

## Editing Code - Definition of Done

1. After editing **any** code, run lint and test **from the root of the repo** to catch issues:

```bash
make lint
make test
```

Run this before considering code changes complete.

2. **Docs updated** - see "Documentation Maintenance".
If unsure whether a doc update is needed, prefer updating the authoritative doc over leaving it stale.

## Documentation Maintenance

Keeping docs in sync with code is part of "done". Before considering a task complete, check whether any of these triggers apply:

| When you... | Update... |
| --- | --- |
| Add/change an API endpoint, handler, repo, DI wiring, or job queue logic | `backend/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Add a SQL migration or change the schema | `backend/ARCHITECTURE.md` (schema section) |
| Add a new design token, component pattern, color, or typography rule | `frontend/DESIGN.md` |
| Add or rename an environment variable | `.env.example` (always) + `README.md` (if user-facing) |
| Change the tech stack or complete a phase | `README.md` |
| Complete or supersede an implementation plan | Mark status in the relevant `../plans/*.md` |
| Make a non-trivial architectural decision | Add a doc under `docs/` (consider an ADR-style filename) |

Agent-generated plans go into ../plans - this is not committed.  When a plan that involved design decisions has
been implemented, examine the documentation and distill the plan across relevant files, using the table above.  Do not
include technical implementation details, those stay in the local-only plan.

## Generated Analysis Files

Files under `docs/analysis/` (e.g. `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`) are **generated snapshots** of the codebase at a point in time. Treat them as read-only reference material:

- **Do not** hand-patch them during feature work -- they will drift and that's expected.
- **Do** regenerate them on demand if the user asks for fresh analysis.
- **Do** put any new generated analysis or reference guides under `docs/analysis/` (not the project root).
- If the information belongs in an authoritative doc (`backend/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `frontend/DESIGN.md`, etc.), update that doc instead of producing a parallel analysis file.

## LLM

Mistral (`mistral-medium-2508`) is the default provider for extraction, report generation, and vision. Voxtral (`voxtral-mini-latest`) is the default for transcription. Both OpenAI and Mistral are supported via `LLM_PROVIDER` env var (`openai` / `mistral`). The active provider's API key must be set (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `MISTRAL_API_KEY`). Provider abstraction lives in `backend/llm_provider*.go`.

## Git Worktrees

To prepare a worktree for running the application, copy the following files from the main tree:

 - .env
 - frontend/.env
 - data/gradebee.db

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live as tasks on the local kanban-md board (`../kanban/tasks/`). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five canonical triage roles, label strings unchanged. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
